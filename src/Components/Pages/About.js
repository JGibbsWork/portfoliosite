            <p className="aboutMe">I'm a fan of things that feel like they make sense. While I cut my teeth in Hospitality and media, I now work in the Software Engineering space. This mix of background career experience gives me a different perspective on how to approach problems and how to consider solutions. I have contributed to open source projects and am currently employed in the FinTech space.</p>

            <p className="aboutMe">For the last 5 years, I managed the "Vibe" of Hotels and Casinos by creating and implementing large-scale strategic, styled ambiance via lighting, music, scent, and media creation across the entire property.In a similar media realm, I also have experience collaborating with independent musicians and their teams to create lyric videos and other social media audio/visual assets.. In addition to media, I excel at securing and maintaining brand partnerships as well. During my time with Hard Rock, I combined forces with renowned music company Fender for a month-long guitar giveaway, and I launched a rental amenity program for Hard Rock Hotels Globally with Crosley Record players. Iâ€™m excited to build something great with you.</p>
